This file contains notes about people active in resilience engineering, as well as some influential
researchers who are no longer with us, organized alphabetically. I'm using
these notes to help get my head around the players and concepts.

You might also be interested in my [notes on David Woods's Resilience Engineering short course](https://github.com/lorin/res-eng-short-course-notes).

For each person, I list concepts that they reference in their writings, along

## Erik Hollnagel

### Contributions

#### ETTO principle

Hollnagel proposed that there is always a fundamental tradeoff between
efficiency and thoroughness, which he called the *ETTO principle*.

#### Safety-I vs. Safety-II

Safety-I: avoiding things that go wrong
* looking at what goes wrong
* bimodal view of work and activities (acceptable vs unacceptable)
* find-and-fix approach
* prevent transition from 'normal' to 'abnormal'
* causality credo: believe that adverse outcomes happen because something goes
  wrong (they have causes that can be found and treated)
* it either works or it doesn't
* systems are decomposable
* functioning is bimodal

Saefty-II: performance variability rather than bimodality
* the system’s ability to succeed under varying conditions, so that the number
  of intended and acceptable outcomes (in other words, everyday activities) is
  as high as possible
* performance is always variable
* performance variation is ubiquitous
* things that go right
* focus on frequent events
* remain sensitive to possibility of failure
* be thorough as well as efficient

#### FRAM

Hollnagel proposed the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) for modeling
complex socio-technical systems.

### Concepts
* ETTO (efficiency thoroughness tradeoff) principle
* FRAM (functional resonance analysis method)
* Safety-I and Safety-II
* things that go wrong vs things that go right

## Jens Rasmussen

Jens Rasmussen was a very influential researcher in human factors and safety systems.

### Contributions

#### Skill-rule-knowledge (SKR) model

TBD

#### Dynamic safety model

Rasmussen proposed a state-based model of a socio-technical system as a system
that moves within a region of a state space. The region is surrounded by
different boundaries:

* economic failure
* unacceptable work load
* functionality acceptable performance

![Migration to the boundary](boundary.png)

Source: [Risk management in a dynamic society: a modelling problem]

Incentives push the system towards the boundary of acceptable performance:
accidents happen when the boundary is exceeded.


#### AcciMaps

TBD

#### Risk management framework

Rasmussen proposed a multi-layer view of socio-technical systems:

researching NASA accidents.  He is one of the founders [Adaptive Capacity
Labs](http://www.adaptivecapacitylabs.com/), a resilience engineering
consultancy.

Woods tweets as [@ddwoods2](https://twitter.com/ddwoods2).

### Contributions

Woods has contributed an enormous number of concepts. 

#### The adaptive universe

Woods uses *the adaptive universe* as a lens for understanding the behavior of
all different kinds of systems.

All systems exist in a dynamic environment, and must adapt to change.

A successful system will need to adapt by virtue of its success.

Systems can be viewed as units of adaptive behavior (UAB) that interact. UABs
exist at different scales (e.g., cell, organ, individual, group, organization).

All systems have competence envelopes, which are constrained by boundaries. 

The resilience of a system is determined by how it behaves when it comes near
to a boundary.

See [Resilience Engineering Short Course](http://csel.org.ohio-state.edu/ResilienceEngineering.html) for more details.

#### Charting adaptive cycles

* Trigger
* Units of adaptive behavior
* Goals and goal conflicts
* Pressure points
* Subcycles

### Graceful extensibility

From [The theory of graceful extensibility: basic rules that govern adaptive systems]:

(Longer wording)

1. Adaptive capacity is finite
2. Events will produce demands that challenge boundaries on the adaptive
   capacity of any UAB
3. Adaptive capacities are regulated to manage the risk of saturating CfM
4. No UAB can have sufficient ability to regulate CfM to manage the risk of saturation alone
5. Some UABs monitor and regulate the CfM of other UABs in response to changes
   in the risk of saturation
6. Adaptive capacity is the potential for adjusting patterns of action to
   handle future situations, events, opportunities and disruptions
7. Performance of a UAB as it approaches saturation is different from the
   perforamnce of that UAB when it operates far from saturation
8. All UABs are local
9. There are bounds on the perspective any UAB, but these limits are overcome
   by shifts and contrasts over multiple perspectives.
10. Reflective systems risk mis-calbiration

(Shorter wording)

1. Boundaries are universal 
2. Surprise occurs, continuously
3. Risk of saturation is monitored and regulated
4. Synchronization across multiple units of adaptive behavior in a network is necessary
5. Risk of saturation can be shared
6. Pressure changes what is sacrificed when
7. Pressure for optimality undermines graceful extensibility
8. All adaptive units are local
9. Perspective contrast overcomes bounds
10. Mis-calibration is the norm
